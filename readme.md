# Learning C++ via Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Implementation

A CNN neural network architecture implemented from scratch in C++ for learning purposes.

- Custom implementation for image classification without ML libraries
- Features:
  - Convolutional layers with configurable kernels
  - Pooling layers
  - Dense layers for classification
  - Tensor3D class for efficient linearised 3D data handling
  - AdamW optimiser
  - Model serialisation (save/load functionality)
- Trained model on MNIST dataset (+augmentation) achieving 99.4% accuracy - see [demo](https://maxkendall.com/cnn_demo/

## Learning Outcomes
- See `learnings.md` for detailed C++ insights gained during implementation.
- Understanding of NN architectures, how they work, and how to train them.

## Requirements
- C++ compiler with C++17 support
- Standard Template Library (STL)
